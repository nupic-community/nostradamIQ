## [Help us](https://github.com/nupic-community/nostradamIQ/blob/master/HOW_TO_CONTRIBUTE.md)!

This is part of a [TEDx-Project](http://datanauts.tedxrheinmain.de/contest-submissions/natural-catashtrophies-prediction-system/); [their Blog about this Contest](http://datanauts.tedxrheinmain.de/blog/meanwhile-in-datanauts-country/) and [nostradamIQ's Blog entery](http://datanauts.tedxrheinmain.de/blog/nostradamiq/)!

See the Pitch!

The idea is to make the world a safe place by making nostradamIQ-prediction more efficient.
This will also lead to a nice tool for visualizing all kinds of natural phenomena, easily searchable with a timescale and choosable info-layers. The core-feature, though, is going to be a layer showing the probability for natural disasters determined by learning time and location based sequences and utilizing other tools like detecting anomal abnormal behavior, preassure and temperature anomalies and (hopefully) combining all to one useful and accurate prediction tool to help local governments and organisations to focus research and prepare for possible nostradamIQs.

### Let's use the technology of today and data from the past to make a better future for all!

"There are only patterns, patterns on top of patterns, patterns that affect other patterns. Patterns hidden by patterns. Patterns within patterns. 
If you watch close, history does nothing but repeat itself."
