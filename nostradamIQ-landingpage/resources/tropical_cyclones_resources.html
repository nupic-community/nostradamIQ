Tropical Cyclones Resources

Tropical cyclones can produce heavy rainfall and sustained winds that can exceed 155 miles per hour (249 km/hr). The official seasons during which cyclones are predicted to become destructive hurricanes and typhoons are different in different areas, but the fact is that, at any time of year, a cyclone is capable of becoming a dangerous hazard.

Q&amp;A: 
What is a Storm Surge?
Storm surge is the most deadly hazard associated with a tropical cyclone. Winds and rain are more obvious, but large swells, high surf, and wind-driven waves push onshore as the storm impacts coastal areas, often causing extensive damage to facilities and the entire shoreline environment. Storm surge can severely erode beaches and damage or undermine highways and bridges.
